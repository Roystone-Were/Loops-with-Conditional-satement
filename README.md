# Number Classifier

## Overview
This Python program, `loopNumbers.py`, is designed to classify numbers from 1 to 20 based on specific rules. The rules are as follows:
- If the number is 4 or 13, it is considered "unlucky."
- If the number is even, it is classified as "even."
- If the number is odd, it is classified as "odd."

The code uses a simple `for` loop to iterate through the numbers and prints the classification for each.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: 
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Roystone-Were/Loops-with-Conditional-satement.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
    ```bash
    cd loopNumbers.py
    ```
3. Run the Python script: 
    ```bash
    python loopNumbers.py
    ```

## Example Output
```plaintext
1 is odd
2 is even
